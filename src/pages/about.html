                          I was very young when my father died. But everyone tells me that his relationship with technology was effortless, he spoke gently and listened carefully, and he was never without a camera. It’s incredible that DNA can leave such a legacy.

                          This work for me is about the ability to synthesize my degree in Information Systems & Technology from Penn State with my desire to represent the individual, and the world around us, in a new and interesting way. The skills I acquired through my education allow me to create professional looking photos, videos, and websites. More importantly, I like people. I want to get to know you and to understand what’s important to you. Whether it’s using a laundromat as a visually pleasing landscape for an individual photo shoot or wading through icy craters for an ethereal wedding shoot, I believe in the work it takes to make every image perfect.
